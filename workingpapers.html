									<p>Abstract: Research on female political representation has tended to overlook the traditional role of women as leaders across many societies. Our study aims to address this gap by investigating the enduring influence of historical female political leadership on contemporary formal political representation in Africa. We test for this persistence by compiling two original datasets: one detailing female political leadership in precolonial societies and another on current female representation in local elections. Our findings indicate that ethnic groups historically allowing women in leadership roles in politics do tend to have a higher proportion of elected female representatives in today's formal local political institutions. We also observe that institutional, rather than economic, factors significantly shape the traditional political influence of women. Moreover, in accordance with historical accounts, we uncover evidence of a reversal of female political power due to institutional changes enforced by colonial powers.</p>

								 <p>Abstract: Through their writing, people often reflect their values. Since the 1970s, academic economists have gradually changed their third-person pronoun choices, from using the masculine form to incorporating feminine and plural forms. We document this transition empirically, and examine the role of social interactions among economists in driving the cultural change reflected in these choices. Our analysis relies on a model where writing style depends on: i) the influence of academic peers, where authors may align with or oppose their peers' stylistic choices, ii) the implicit negotiation between co-authors, and iii) individual authors' preferences for expressing gender equality values in their writing. We directly measure peer influences relying on detailed time-varying information on academic connections between economists, and propose a methodology where, relying on a homophily-based model of co-authoring decisions, we can isolate the effect of peer influence from unobserved personal preferences. The model allows us to decompose the observed changes in writing style over the last 50 years into generational shifts, the increasing prevalence of co-authorship in the profession, the increasing share of female economists, and peer influence. Generational changes and the growing share of women in the profession play a minor role.Early on, the pace of change in writing styles was accelerated by the presence of contrarian economists moving away from their peer's behavior. The large fraction of conformists and the overall homophily in co-authoring, which restricts economists' exposure to peers with different gender-attitude signaling preferences, in contrast, slowed the adoption of innovative writing styles.</p>

<p>Abstract: This paper examines how the absence of female professors affects graduates from top-50 U.S. economics Ph.D. programs. We leverage quasi-random variation in sabbatical timing and detailed data on advisor relationships and career outcomes. When a female professor goes on leave, third-year female Ph.D. students become 19 percent less likely to secure academic placements and publish 31 percent fewer early-career papers. Remarkably, male students in the same cohort experience corresponding gains, fully offsetting the losses of their female peers. We parse publication effects from placement outcomes. Treated women continue to publish less even after accounting for placement, while men's publication gains appear entirely driven by improved placement. Gender homophily in mentorship—female students are 51 percent more likely than male students to have female advisors—helps explain these patterns, along with zero-sum dynamics in the junior job market. Adding one senior female professor to each top-50 department would close one-third of the assistant professor gender gap at top-25 schools.</p>

									<p>Abstract: In the 1920s, the United States introduced immigration quotas to limit arrivals from Eastern and Southern Europe (ESE). Intended to discourage low-skilled immigration, the quotas exempted scientists and students. We use biographical data on more than 80,000 American scientists to investigate the quotas' effects on innovation. These data show that the quotas discouraged ESE-born scientists from studying and working in the United States. To investigate effects on innovation, we use the world-wide universe of publications to identify research fields in which ESE-based science was prominent before the quotas. Difference-in-difference analyses show that, after the quotas, US innovation experienced a large and persistent decline in ESE fields. A decomposition exercise reveals that the quotas reduced innovation by lowering the productivity of incumbent scientists and by replacing immigrants with less productive natives. As US scientists produced fewer innovations in ESE fields, Canada gained relative to the United States.</p>

								 <p>Abstract: How do people react when the candidate they supported wins or loses an election? I explore the consequences of having supported a winning (or losing) candidate on future political participation. I begin by presenting two empirical patterns: 1) there is a positive relationship between county vote share to the winning party and future voter turnout in that county, 2) there is no significant change in the party composition of votes, suggesting that the increase in political participation percolates to voters of all persuasions. I provide evidence for a combination of an "individual" and a "community" effect to explain this joint pattern. While winning voters are "encouraged" by the win of their preferred candidate compared to losing voters, losing voters appear to be galvanized by being surrounded by winners. In the data, the two effects happen to balance, highlighting the significance of peer effects on voter participation.</p>
